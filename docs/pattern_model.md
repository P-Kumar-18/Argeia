# Behavioral State Transition Specification
*(Argeia – Patterns Model)*

## Purpose of Patterns

Patterns determine whether signals represent noise or habit formation.

A window represents a bounded sequence of recent tasks used to evaluate behavioral consistency.

---

## Signal Strength

Signal strength describes how large a deviation is **relative to the task**.

There are three types of signal strength:

- **Weak Signal** — Small relative deviation
- **Moderate Signal** — Moderate relative deviation
- **Strong Signal** — Large relative deviation

## Patterns

### Pattern Polarity

Pattern polarity describes the directional tendency of a detected pattern.

There are two types of pattern polarity:

- **Negative Pattern** — Indicates behavioral degradation pressure
- **Positive Pattern** — Indicates behavioral improvement pressure

Sustained patterns are defined separately and govern recovery behavior.

---

### Pattern Confirmation

Pattern confirmation determines whether observed signals represent a real behavioral tendency or temporary noise.

A pattern is considered **unconfirmed** when:
- signals are isolated
- signals are sparse within a window

A pattern becomes **confirmed** when:
- similar signals recur consistently within a window
- or when unconfirmed patterns appear in adjacent windows

---

### Pattern Strength

Pattern strength represents the intensity of a confirmed behavioral pattern.

Strength does not determine whether a pattern exists.

It determines how impactful the pattern is once confirmed.

Confirmed patterns are classified into two strength levels:
- LOW
- HIGH

Pattern strength is influenced by:
- the magnitude of individual signals (strong vs weak deviations)
- the density of signals within a window
- the presence of extreme signals (e.g. full timeout)

Pattern strength is evaluated only after pattern confirmation.

---

### Pattern Severity (Interpretation Layer Responsibility)

Patterns do not contain severity.

Severity is derived by the behavior evaluation layer after patterns are detected.

While pattern strength describes intensity within a window (LOW or HIGH), severity describes how strongly the system should react to that pattern.

Severity is determined by:

- Pattern strength
- The number of confirmed patterns within a window
- Escalation rules defined in the behavior evaluation layer

The pattern detection layer never assigns severity.

The state engine only consumes severity via proposals.

---

## Sustained Positive Patterns (Interpretation Layer Responsibility)

Sustainment is not a property of a single pattern.

A sustained positive condition is derived by the behavior evaluation layer when:

- Confirmed positive patterns exist across consecutive windows
- No degradation proposal is triggered during that period

Pattern detection identifies confirmed positive patterns per window.

The behavior evaluation layer determines whether those patterns constitute sustained improvement.

---

## Positive Patterns

Positive patterns represent behavioral improvement.

Unlike negative patterns:
- confirmed positive patterns alone do not change state; a recovery proposal must be generated by the behavior evaluation layer
- recovery requires sustained positive patterns across multiple windows

This asymmetry prevents over-rewarding short-term improvement.
